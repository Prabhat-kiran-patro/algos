to add more algorithms we have to do the following:
- add a link/button in home.html
- add a header & title condition in algorithm.html
- we may also need different kind of forms(with more input fields) for some algorithms, have to keep that in mind
- handle the route in algorithm function in app.py
- add a module for that algorithm in algorithms folder


but it seems that size of this project will be scary when many algorithms are added
